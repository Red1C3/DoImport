# DoImport

DoImport is a C++ libaby which aims to support some common file format to import into other projects, especially projects involving game devlopment and computer graphics.
## Description
For now the project only supports basic importing for GLTF Files (with BIN file separeted) format, but it will be updated to support more features in the future.
## Installation
Import lib files from \bin and add \include folder to your project include path, in case lib files aren't complitiable with your compiler, you can build the lib easily.
## Usage
An example project is included in \examples with a GLTF File plus a BIN file.
## Roadmap
The project WILL support at least PNG Files support, more files formats will be supported later on too.
## Contributing
The project is open for contributions, try to follow my pattern in coding, a special class for each special format.
